# Mission 31: Upgradable smart contract

<img src="images/upgradable.jpeg" alt="upgradable"/>

## Overview

Build an upgradeable smart contract application on Shardeum which lets the deployer change a variable in the contract with a proxy.

## Requirements

Create a smart contract called: `UpgradableContract` which:
        
- is deployed to [Sphinx Dapp 1.X](https://docs.shardeum.org/network/endpoints#shardeum-sphinx-dapp-1x) network.

- has a contract `UpgradableContract`
     - which contains the variable that can be modified (Example: uint256 public importantVariable;)

    - this contract also contains a function to modify `importantVariable` (Example: function changeImportantVariable(uint256 newValue))

    - this contract must include an upgrade function that allows the contract deployer to change the logic within the contract (Example: function upgradeContract(address newImplementation))
    - ensure that only the original deployer can change the implementation to prevent malicious upgrades
- has a proxy contract `ProxyContract`
    - this contract is the one users interact with and forwards calls to `UpgradableContract`
    - this contract must be able to change the reference to `UpgradableContract` to allow upgrades
    - make sure only the original deployer can change the reference to `UpgradableContract` to prevent malicious upgrades

           
Create a basic frontend which:

    - is hosted on IPFS/Filecoin using Fleek/Spheron for easy access
    - allows user to connect Metamask wallet with a button
    - allows the user to read the initial(before upgrade) and final(after upgrade) value
    - allows the user to change the value/update


## Submission
